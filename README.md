# Data Fetcher with Threading

## Description

This Python script fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), processes it using multithreading for efficiency, and writes the results to a JSON file. The script uses threading to handle multiple HTTP requests concurrently, improving the overall data fetching time.

### Prerequisites
